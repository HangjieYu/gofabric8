== Uninstalling Minishift

.  Delete the Minishift VM and any VM-specific files.
+
----
$ minishift delete
----
+
This command deletes everything in the
`MINISHIFT_HOME/.minishift/machines/minishift` directory. Other cached data and
the link:../using/managing-minishift.html#persistent-configuration[persistent configuration] are not removed.

.  To completely uninstall Minishift, delete everything in the
`MINISHIFT_HOME` directory (default `~/.minishift`) and `~/.kube`:
+
----
$ rm -rf ~/.minishift
$ rm -rf ~/.kube
----

.  With your hypervisor management tool, confirm that there are no
remaining artifacts related to the Minishift VM. For example, if you use
KVM, you need to run the `virsh` command.
